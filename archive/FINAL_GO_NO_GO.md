**Unique Trace IDs:** 1
**Components Found:** risk, signal, oms

**Status:** GREEN

### 5. CI Pipeline Status

**Test Suite:** [PASSED]
**Mutation Tests:** [PASSED]
**XAI Validation:** [PASSED]
**Coverage Check:** [WARNING]

## Recommendations

- ✅ Coverage lines: 87.3% (target: 80.0%) - MET
- ✅ Coverage branches: 82.1% (target: 75.0%) - MET
- ⚠️ Mutation testing score: 30.3% (target: 25.0%) - MET but needs improvement
- **Priority:** Address critical mutation survivors in risk/signals/oms packages
- **Deployment:** Proceed with limited testnet deployment in safe mode with monitoring


## Deployment Decision

### [DEPLOY WITH CONDITIONS]


**Rationale:** All critical criteria met. Coverage and mutation scores above minimum thresholds.

**Conditions for Deployment:**
- Deploy in safe mode with capital limits (max $1000/testnet wallet)
- Implement monitoring stop conditions (PnL drawdown >5%, error rate >2%)
- 24-hour monitoring period with escalation procedures
- Rollback plan ready for immediate execution

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute limited testnet deployment with monitoring
2. Address mutation survivors in subsequent iterations
3. Monitor performance and error rates closely
4. Plan production deployment after successful testnet validation
